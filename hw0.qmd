## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r}

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
penguins %>%
ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
labs(
x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)",
color = "Species", shape = "Species"
) +
scale_color_colorblind()
```
